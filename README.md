# TruthTableMaker
This program makes a truth table for you by taking the number of inputs and outputs desired. For use of 7-segment or 16-segment LEDs, the program creates your outputs based on the letters that you input to the program.
Useful for projects relating to circuitry.
In the near future, this program will extend to dot-matrix LEDs and implement Quine-McClusky Algorithm to simplify boolean equations
