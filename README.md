# TruthTableMaker
This program makes a truth table for you by taking the number of inputs and outputs desired. For use of 7-segment or 16-segment LEDs, the program creates your outputs based on the letters that you input to the program.
Useful for projects relating to circuitry, especially with 7-segment or 16-segment LEDs.
The program will ask you the number of inputs, the number of outputs, and whether you are using a 7-segment LED, a 16-segment LED, or no LED and just a truth table. If you are using a 7-segment LED, the program will ask you to type hexadecimal characters 1 per line on the console. If you are using a 16-segment LED, the program will ask you to type alphanumeric characters (uppercase, lowercase, and/or numbers). For the LEDs, the program will type your binary outputs for the LED on the Excel automatically (exciting feature isn't it?). Not only that, but the program will also generate a .txt file called "equations.txt" with all your simplified boolean equations. If you are not using any LEDs, the program will ask you to type your outputs on the excel file. After you do so, close and save the file, and type "done" on the console, which will cause the program to open your excel file and a text file that will show you your simplified equations.
In the near future, this program will extend to dot-matrix LEDs and implement Quine-McClusky Algorithm to simplify boolean equations
